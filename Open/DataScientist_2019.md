# Data Scientist opening at [DAPPER Stats](https://www.dapperstats.com)

[DAPPER Stats](https://www.dapperstats.com) is hiring! We are seeking a motivated data scientist to join our team and help expand our company by assisting with ongoing projects focused on Pacific coast fisheries, avian impacts of renewable power facilities, and wetland mitigation designs, as well as by leading new projects aligned with their interests.

**Posted**: 2019-10-03

**Stage 1 deadline**: 2019-10-18

### Position Overview

The position is provisionally titled "Data Scientist", but we recognize that different career paths recognize particular titles and are amenable to renaming the position as needed.

In many ways, this position is akin to an academic post-doc, but with the opportunity to develop and expand the role to suit the employee's desires and DAPPER's needs.

The ideal candidate is: 
* interested in applied computational, statistical, and/or theoretical ecology (or related fields)
* happy to take on existing projects that have defined scopes
* able to (over time, with training and assistance) develop and foster collaborations and client relationships
* looking for science careers outside of academia
* potentially keen to take a leadership role in DAPPER and help guide the company's development
* willing and able to oversee administrative tasks on projects

The specifics of the position, including which projects the scientist will be involved with, are open to discussion and conversation.

As a company, DAPPER Stats is dedicated to challenging and dismantling barriers of systematic oppression and gatekeeping. We seek to specifically leverage employment and training opportunities in this fight. As such, we especially encourage individuals with diverse backgrounds and members of traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities to apply. 

### Desired skills and education

We are looking for employees with the following range of skills and trainings:
* scientific process: able to oversee a scientific project from conception to publication
* coding: proficiency with the software and languages of their choice (DAPPER is language agnostic)
* analyses: capability to analyze complex data sets (non-normal, 0-heavy, missing data, autocorrelation, etc.) as part of a research project
* writing: able to write scientific documents for a variety of audiences (technical reports, manuscripts, etc.)
 
The ideal candidate will be well-versed scientifically. This likely means that they will have a Ph.D., but that is not a strict requirement. 

### Logistics

The ideal start date is January 2020, but work is available now so the start date can be earlier, or the start can be pushed back if needed.

Salary: $60,000 / year

Medical: health care and dental via the [ACA's Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP)](https://www.healthcare.gov/small-businesses/employers/)

Additional Benefits: standard federally required benefits (COBRA, Disability, FMLA, Unemployment, Worker's Comp), flexible schedule and location, business development training

This position will ideally be for 2 years, with the possibility of developing into a longer-term role. We are a startup company and unfortunately cannot guarantee funding that far in advance. What we can guarantee, however, is a fully-funded (with benefits) position for 6 months, access to projects to lead that could generate additional support, a high likelihood for funding beyond 6 months. 

DAPPER is presently located in Portland, Oregon, USA. Given the nature of our work, telecommuting or working remotely are suitable for this position. If you are not in Portland and are interested in relocating, we can help cover moving costs.

### Submission and evaluation

The evaluation process will occur in three stages:

#### First Stage

Candidates should submit the following to express their interest in the position:
* A letter of interest (maximum 1 page)
  * Tell us about yourself. We are particularly interested in your background and interests as a person outside of what is covered/focused on in your CV. 
  * Consider answering questions like: "Why are you interested in this position?", "What are your career goals?/What are you looking for in a career?", "What challenges do you face in your daily work life?", "How does your work fit into your life more broadly?"
* Your CV
  * Can be any length or format
* A single exemplar of your work
  * Provide one product that captures the breadth and/or depth of your work on a project.
  * Examples include link to a software application, a manuscript, or slides of a talk.
  * If necessary, provide an accompanying paragraph of text explaining the product's context.

Submissions for the first stage will be accepted through October 18 2019 (closing time: 2019-10-18 23:59:59 UTC-7).

#### Second Stage

From the letters, CVs, and examples, a set of candidates will be selected to submit a more detailed application including a portfolio and list of references.

#### Third Stage

From the portfolios and references, a final set of candidates will be selected for in-person or video interviews. 
This stage will involve presenting a bit about your research and answering some questions in real time.

### Background 

A little about the company:

DAPPER LLC (aka DAPPER Stats) is a small company based in Portland, OR that provides on-point quantitative scientific support services with a current focus on wildlife conservation. I, Dr. Juniper Simonis (they/them pronouns) started DAPPER in May 2015 and to date have been its sole employee. Building upon existing scientific collaborations and expanding into new areas, I have garnered work through governmental (tribal, state, federal), academic, non-profit, and consulting collaborations to build DAPPER into a sustainable and growing company. Over the past four and a half years, I have steadily grown DAPPERâ€™s client base and now have enough projects to support an additional staff member. I am in the process of building DAPPER into a non-academic research laboratory with multiple staff members across a range of experiences engaged in a variety of projects, and this position is the first step towards that. Hence the job posting you are reading! 

You can find our [Mission and Vision](https://github.com/dapperstats/Lab_Documents/blob/master/Mission_and_Vision.md) on our organization's [GitHub page](https://github.com/dapperstats)

The work I presently do spans a variety of organisms and ecosystems, with a particular focus on estimating small populations from incomplete samples. Recently, this has involved work on endangered fishes in the California Delta, birds and bats at renewable power facilities, and cooperatively managed wolf reintroductions. In addition to producing academic and technical literature, I am really into building tools that help front-end users (e.g., wildlife managers, plant operators) understand core concepts and leverage contemporary statistical tools with push-button ease.
